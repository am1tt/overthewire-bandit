## ðŸŽ¯ Bandit Level 13 â†’ Level 14

**Level Goal:**  
The password for the next level is stored in `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14` and can only be read by user **bandit14**. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password directly, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level.  
Note: `localhost` is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on.
